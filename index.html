            Chadwick Boseman, in full Chadwick Aaron Boseman, (born November 29, 1976, Anderson, South Carolina, U.S.—died August 28, 2020, Los Angeles, California), American actor and playwright who became a highly respected movie star with several iconic roles, notably that of T’Challa/Black Panther in the groundbreaking film Black Panther (2018).

            Boseman was the youngest of three children. His father worked for an agricultural conglomerate and did upholstery work on the side, and his mother was a nurse. He played basketball as a high-school student, but when a teammate was shot and killed, Boseman responded by writing a play and found that he felt called to become a storyteller. After graduating from high school in 1995, he studied directing at Howard University (B.F.A., 2000). While a student there, he took (1998) acting classes in a summer program of the British American Drama Academy at the University of Oxford and visited Ghana.
